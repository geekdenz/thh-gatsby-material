<p>Today, I'm about to cook something I haven't cooked in quite a while. It's called Gesunder Nudelauflauf (in German - Healthy Pasta Casserole), or better, I just called it that because I couldn't come up with a better name. This is mainly for my own reference, but I thought, I'd share it.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carrots (~3-4)</li>
<li>Broccoli (1)</li>
<li>Coliflower (1/2)</li>
<li>Pasta (Pene) (500g)</li>
<li>Tomatoes (2-3)</li>
<li>Feta Cheese (1 pack ~250g)</li>
<li>Grated Cheese (~200g)</li>
<li>Flower (1 tbsp)</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Milk (to liking, ~50ml)</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>The order of making things you can optimise to use the least amount of time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil ~1/2 pot of water put (carrots in first) vegetables cut into pieces. Boil for ~10-15 minutes, depending on whether you want them soft or on the hard side. Add Chicken stock or similar or salt and pepper to liking. Important: keep water content as low as possible and do not get rid of the water after.</li>
<li>Make a "Schwitze" (roux): put some flour (1 tbsp initially) and butter (1 tbsp) into a small pot (preferable) or pan, wait until golden brown, add water from boiled vegetables (to keep the nutrients), add milk until you have a thick soup.</li>
<li>Boil pasta until al dente with salt to liking.</li>
<li>After vegetables are ready, put them into a casserole dish, put unboiled tomatoes and feta cut into pieces over. Add pasta and finish with the "Schwitze" on top. Add grated cheese on top.</li>
<li>Put into oven at 200 degrees (centigrade) for 30-45 minutes (check).</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><br />
<br/></p>
<p>Voila! You should have made a reasonably healthy pasta casserole. Please comment if it works out well. :-)</p>
