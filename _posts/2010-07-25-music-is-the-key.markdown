<p>I would like to write something down that I learned in my music lessons:</p>
<p>Order of sharps: Fat Cats Get Down And Elegantly Boogy (FCGDAEB).</p>

<p>Order of flats: Big Elephants Always Do Great Circus Feats (BEADGCF).</p>
<p>This is related to the Circle of Fifths or also called Circle of Fourths. This circle is quite important in music as the number of flats or sharps depends on the position of the major scale in this circle. From the top it goes CGDA...</p>
<p>This post is really just for me to remember.</p>
