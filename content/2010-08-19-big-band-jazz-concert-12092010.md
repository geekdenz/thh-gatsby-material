<p>On Sunday 12/09/2010 at 4.30pm there is a concert of the Manawatu Jazz Club Big Band at the <a title="Directions" href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Masonic+Hotel,+Manawatu-wanganui&amp;sll=-40.355746,175.61219&amp;sspn=0.062528,0.169086&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Masonic+Hotel,&amp;hnear=Manawatu-wanganui&amp;ll=-40.357909,175.607057&amp;spn=0.007407,0.021136&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank">Masonic Hotel</a>, which I am part of. I will be playing at least one solo, so be prepared, whatever that means :)</p>
<p>There might be a small cover charge, however last time it was not compulsory.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there. If you are into Jazz it is well worth the visit. We often have high quality singers and we are generally well accepted.</p>
