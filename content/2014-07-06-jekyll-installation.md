Jekyll is the software I'm using for this blog. So, just as a reminder for myself and people who want to try it out, I thought I would document here, how to install it.

You can simply follow these steps:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install -y ruby1.9.1-dev && \
sudo gem install jekyll && \
sudo gem install jekyll-tagging
{% endhighlight %}

That's all! Now you can create your sites with the easy to use content management system.
